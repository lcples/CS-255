# CS-255

#Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project has the goal providing students with the ability to take online classes, practice tests, and live training sessions with drivers to pass their DMV tests. Liam is the owner and the client. The client wanted to take advantage of the lack of training for DMV students. 

#What did you do particularly well?
I struggled with this project alot, but I will say that coming up with requirements from the interview given would be my strength. It was interesting pulling out details from a non-exptert point of view and applying it to a project.

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
It would definately be my activity diagrams. I struggle to be understand how to create these diagrams. They lack substance and if I had a better understanding of how to translate information to them I might have done better.

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I took what the client said and came to conclusions based on the interview. For example, many different types of devices need to be supported for ease of access. This means that a web-based app would be the best solution since it is compatabile with so many common devices. The user is the one who is going to end up suffering if you do not consider thier needs while designing. It would be a failed project if they can not use the system properly.

#How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I would start with a requirements sheet. This will give a good understanding of what the system does and needs. Then I can create diagrams that would expand my understanding of the system. A strategy I would use is using my previously created diagrams as a resource more often for better continuity and to prevent errors.
